Writing an email server is a complex task that involves several components, including handling the SMTP protocol for sending email, the IMAP/POP3 protocols for receiving email, user authentication, and managing storage for messages. Below are the general steps to write an email server:

### 1. **Understand Email Protocols**
   - **SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol):** Responsible for sending emails between servers.
   - **IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) or POP3 (Post Office Protocol):** Responsible for retrieving emails from the server to the client.
   - Learn the standards: 
     - RFC 5321 for SMTP
     - RFC 3501 for IMAP
     - RFC 1939 for POP3

### 2. **Choose a Programming Language**
   Decide on the language you will use. Popular options include:
   - **Python:** Offers libraries like `smtplib`, `asyncore` for socket handling, and `imaplib`.
   - **Go:** Has strong support for concurrency, which is useful for handling multiple clients.
   - **C/C++:** Provides fine control over sockets and memory but requires more code to handle complex tasks.
   
### 3. **Setup SMTP Server**
   - **Create a Listener:** Write code that listens for connections on port 25 (SMTP port).
   - **Handle HELO/EHLO Command:** Respond to the client’s initial handshake request.
   - **Authenticate Users:** Implement a basic authentication system (can be optional for some servers).
   - **Queue Emails:** Write code to handle queuing emails for delivery.
   - **Forward Emails:** Implement logic to forward email to the correct destination servers based on the recipient’s domain.
   - **Error Handling:** Respond with appropriate SMTP error codes if issues occur.

### 4. **Setup IMAP/POP3 Server**
   - **IMAP (for retrieving email):** 
     - Implement commands like `LOGIN`, `SELECT`, `FETCH`, `STORE`, `EXPUNGE`, etc.
     - Manage mailboxes and allow clients to retrieve or delete emails.
   - **POP3 (optional):** 
     - Implement basic commands like `USER`, `PASS`, `RETR`, `DELE`, etc.
     - Handle client requests to retrieve and delete emails.
   
### 5. **Implement User Management and Authentication**
   - **Database for User Data:** Store user accounts and their password hashes securely (e.g., using bcrypt).
   - **Login Mechanism:** Validate users upon login requests with proper authentication.
   
### 6. **Message Storage**
   - **Maildir Format:** Store emails in a directory where each message is a file.
   - **Mbox Format:** Store emails in a single file with all messages concatenated together.
   - **Database Storage (optional):** Use databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or even NoSQL like MongoDB to store emails.

### 7. **Handle DNS (Domain Name System)**
   - **MX Records:** Understand how to resolve MX records (Mail Exchange) to find the mail servers for a domain.
   - **SPF, DKIM, DMARC:** Implement support for email security standards to prevent spoofing and improve deliverability.

### 8. **Develop the SMTP Client**
   - Create a client that connects to other email servers to send email.
   - Handle communication between email servers (SMTP relay).

### 9. **Security**
   - **TLS/SSL Encryption:** Secure communication using TLS (usually over port 587 or 465).
   - **SPF, DKIM, and DMARC:** Add support for email security protocols to prevent spoofing.
   - **Anti-Spam and Anti-Virus:** Consider implementing filtering for spam and malware.

### 10. **Testing**
   - **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for the various components like sending, receiving, and authenticating emails.
   - **Integration Testing:** Test the interaction between SMTP, IMAP/POP3, and the storage system.
   - **Load Testing:** Make sure the server can handle multiple connections concurrently.
   - **Compliance Testing:** Ensure the server complies with SMTP, IMAP, and POP3 RFCs.

### 11. **Deploy the Email Server**
   - **Install on a Production Machine:** Deploy the server on a dedicated server or cloud platform.
   - **Use Firewalls and Security Best Practices:** Configure firewalls to allow only necessary ports (25, 587, 465 for SMTP; 143, 993 for IMAP; 110, 995 for POP3).

### 12. **Logging and Monitoring**
   - Set up logging for monitoring the server activity (log sent emails, received emails, errors, etc.).
   - Use monitoring tools to track uptime and performance.

### Tools and Libraries
- **Python:** `smtplib`, `asyncore`, `imaplib`, `email`
- **Go:** `net/smtp`, `net/textproto`
- **C++:** Boost.Asio for networking

This process requires understanding networking protocols, security measures, and efficient handling of system resources. For a robust solution, many systems also incorporate existing libraries to handle common tasks like authentication and encryption.
